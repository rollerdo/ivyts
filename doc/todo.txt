1. (Completed) Fix JSON undefined.
   a. All $Value properties have either a valid defined value or are set to undefined. When writing to JSON, undefined
      values are stored as null but when rehydrated, all nulls are converted to undefined in their respective objects.
2. (Completed) Add ability to know that a child property has changed from any level of parent
   a. $Value.setChanged() sets the changed $Value and all its $Complex owners up the owner chain
   b. $Property.clearChanged() clears the changed property for itself and all its children.
   c. $Complex properties maintain an object set that contains a key for each of its direct children that have 
      changed. When the set is empty, the changed property will be false; otherwise it is true.
