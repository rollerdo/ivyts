1. Add ability to know that a child property has changed from any level of parent
2. Figure out what to do with icons
3. Add actions and action objects and corresponding views

Notes:
1. All $Value properties have either a valid defined value or are set to undefined. When writing to JSON, undefined
    values are stored as null but when rehydrated, all nulls are converted to undefined in their respective objects.
